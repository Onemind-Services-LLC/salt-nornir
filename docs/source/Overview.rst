Overview of Nornir proxy Minion.

Why use Nornir with SALT?
=========================

**First of all, scaling**

Salt Nornir modules help to address scaling issues of interacting with
devices at high numbers (hundreds to tens of thousands) effectively using resources (accomplish 
more with less), but without sacrificing execution speed.

To demonstrate, for each network device to manage with SALT, there is a 
dedicated proxy-minion process configured and started together with additional 
(watchdog) process to manage it. Each pair of processes consumes about 110 MByte (numbers 
might differ depending on environment and serve as example only) of RAM providing in return 
capability to interact with a single device.

With nornir-proxy, while each proxy-minion consumes more RAM and also requires 
2 processes to operate, Nornir Proxy minion capable of managing multiple network devices.

As a result, the more devices single Nornir proxy minion manage, the less overall resources 
used. However, the more devices, the longer it usually takes to execute tasks - time vs
resources problem - at one extreme, single Nornir proxy can manage one device only, giving the 
fastest execution time, on the other hand, Nornir proxy minion can run tasks against 1000 
devices, crawling them over several minutes. 

Optimal number of devices managed by single Nornir proxy depends on the environment it operates in
and should be decided on a case by case basis. 

.. note:: each connection to device requires resources to operate, usually around 2-3MByte of RAM
    per device, but might vary depending on environment and plugins in use.

**Secondly, extendability and interoperability**

Nornir is Python, SALT is Python, Nornir is pluggable framework, SALT is pluggable 
framework, Nornir is open-source, SALT has open-source community version - sounds like a nice fit 
and it really is. 

Given that both frameworks expose themselves using Python and support modules/plugins, tinkering 
capabilities are endless. Several examples:

(1) Conventional Proxy Minion locked in certain way of interacting with network 
devices, normally using library of choice. Nornir, on the other hand, handles interactions 
via plugins, meaning, same Nornir Proxy minion can use various means to interact with devices. 
For instance, support coded for popular open-source libraries such as Netmiko, NAPALM 
and Scrapli. New Nornir plugins (e.g. task and connection plugins) should be supported by 
Nornir Proxy minion as well

(2) SALT has schedulers, returners, REST API, pillar, beacons, event bus, mine, templating etc. systems,
all of them available for use with Nornir Proxy Minion, allowing to save significant amount of time 
on addressing various use cases that otherwise would turn in a tangible coding exercise. New SALT modules 
and capabilities should interoperate with Nornir proxy minion seamlessly.

How it works
============

Wrapping Nornir in salt-proxy-minion allowing to run jobs against multiple devices. As a result, single
proxy process can deliver configuration or retrieve state from multiple devices. Moreover, Nornir proxy 
has support for long running connections to devices and shares access to connections with child 
processes. Recommended way to run this proxy is with ``multiprocessing`` set to ``True``.

.. image:: ./_images/Nornir-proxy-minion_architecture.png

To facilitate long running connections, proxy-minion designed to use queues for inter-process jobs communication.

This architecture helps avoid these problems:

* If no long running connections exists to devices, each new task creates dedicated connections to devices, increasing overall execution time
* Increase in the number of connections increases load on AAA system (Tacacs, Radius) as more tasks result in more authentication requests from devices

.. image:: ./_images/nornir_proxy_inter_process_communication_v0.png

Above architecture prone to these **drawbacks**:

* Double targeting required to narrow down tasks execution to a subset of hosts
* In addition to knowing how pillar works, one will have to know how `Nornir inventory <https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/tutorial/inventory.html>`_ 
    structured to use it effectively, as Nornir inventory integrated in proxy-minion pillar
* Tasks executed sequentially one after another, if a lot of tasks scheduled simultaneously, they will consume resource waiting to execute

To address double targeting, Nornir filtering capabilities utilized using additional filtering functions, reference nornir-salt module 
`FFun function <https://nornir-salt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Functions.html#ffun>`_ for more information. But in short,
have to use ``Fx`` parameters to filter hosts, for example::

    # target only IOL1 and IOL2 hosts:
    salt nrp1 nr.cli "show clock" FB="IOL[12]"
    
Nornir process watchdog or known issues
=======================================

Slowly crashlooping system is usually preferable to a system that simply stops working.

To address various issues that can happen during lifespan of Nornir Proxy minion process
each such a process has watchdog thread running. Watchdog constantly execute checks 
on a predefined intervals controlled by ``watchdog_interval`` parameter (default 30s).

Problems watchdog should be capable of handling:

1. **Memory overconsumption**. ``memory_threshold_mbyte`` and ``memory_threshold_action`` 
proxy minion settings can help to prevent proxy minion process from running out of memory.
Normally, because Nornir Proxy minion uses multiprocessing to run tasks instead of 
threading it is not prone to memory leak issues, however, having 
capability to log or restart process in response to consuming too much memory can 
be helpful in extreme cases like bugs in new software releases.

2. **Stale child processes**. During nornir proxy minion testing was detected that some
child processes started to execute tasks might stuck for unknown reason. Probably 
bug of some sort. That usually leads to child process running indefinitely, consuming
system resources and task never been completed. To mitigate that problem, watchdog
runs lifespan detection for all child process by measuring their age, if age
grows beyond ``child_process_max_age`` parameter (default 660s), watchdog kills such 
a process.

3. **Stale connections to devices**. Sometime connections to devices might become unusable.
For instance device rebooted or network connectivity issue. Nornir plugins usually not 
capable of recovering from such a problems, as a result watchdog runs connection checks to 
confirm they are alive, clearing them otherwise.

3.1. **Connections keepalives**. Common connections liveness detection mechanism usually 
requires sending some data down the connection channel, receiving some data from device 
in response. Because of that, connections effectively kept alive, preventing them from 
timing out on device end due to inactivity.

4. **Running out of file descriptors (fd) problem**. On Unix systems each process can have
limited number of file descriptors created, usually around 1000, because Nornir proxy 
minion uses multiprocessing queues for inter-process communications, effectively creating 
pipes on a lower level, each such a pipe consume file descriptor. But after child 
processes destroyed, not all fds deleted for some reason, fd leaking after reaching OS limit
prevents proxy minion process from running tasks. Watchdog on each run creates and destroys 
test pipes, restarting Nornir proxy minion process on failure to do so. Nornir proxy minion
process restart leads to clearing of all previously created pipes and release of file descriptors. 
Future Nornir proxy releases might include a fix for this problem, but other reasons might 
lead to fd leaks, having mechanism in place to detect and recover from such a problem could 
be of great benefit regardless.
